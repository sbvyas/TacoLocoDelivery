# TacoLocoDelivery
* Sample Delivery API for TacoLoco

* Documentation
Please refer https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6683735/TVsxARD2#intro for POSTMAN docs with request and response details of all the API's created for TacoLoco deliveries.

* Instructions
I have used Visual Studio 2019 to develop this backend service. NuGet is used as pacakge manager. Please note as mentioned in my resume too, I am still learning how to write unit tests using MSTest but it is not yet ready.
I wanted to submit working API and will keep pushing new commits with unit and integration tests as I learn them and get time to write them.
